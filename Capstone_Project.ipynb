    "# Business Problem and Project Objective\n",
    "- The business problem is to predict the level of severity in case of a traffic collusion based on the given the details of the collusion. \n",
    "- The audience of this problem would be the Police Department, local authorities, insurance companies and also the health sector in case of injuries. \n",
    "- This business problem is a classification problem and the objective of the project is to build a classifier model to make this prediction.\n",
    "- To achieve this purpose the data taken from Seattle Police Department and Seattle Traffic Department will be used. The data is provided by Cursera within the framework of ML Capstone project.\n",
    "- Nevertheless, first we need to understand, prepare and analyze the data.\n",
    "- Then, we can use different classification models and compare their performance to come up with the best model. "

    "# Data\n",
    "- The data is taken from Seattle Police Department and Seattle Traffic Department records. It is provided by Cursera within the framework of ML Capstone project.\n",
    "- It has 38 columns and 194672 rows. 16 columns are numerical and the rest is categorical or object variables. \n",
    "- The data includes details of a traffic collusion including different types of IDs, location, address, date and time, severity, collusion type, number of persons and vehicles, weather, condition of the road etc. \n",
    "- We need to look at the details of the data to understand it and to analyze and prepare it to come up with the optimum data for the classification models.\n",
    "- The data manipulation, EDA and data preprocessing steps will be executed for this purpose. \n",
